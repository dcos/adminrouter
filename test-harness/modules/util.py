    This class is meant to simplify searching of particular strings in line
    buffers created by LogCatcher object for subprocess run by this test
    harness.

    It exposes two interfaces:
    * context manager interface for isolating logs from particular event, i.e.
        lbf = LineBufferFilter(filter_string,
                               line_buffer=ar_process.stderr_line_buffer)

                                headers=header)

        assert lbf.log_line_found

        In this case log buffer will be scanned only for entries that were added
        while executing the `requests.get()` call.

    * `.scan_log_buffer()` approach in case string should be searched from the
        begining of the log.
